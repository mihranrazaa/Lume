* SO the plan is to build a alternative of kindle why? because from what i have seen on youtube, kindle can ban your account and your purchased books will be gone, sometimes when the deal between kindle and author of some book gets expired the books automatically vanishes from your account which is crazy, someone is paying full price but still he is not owning that piece, like it is not even a clooud service where subscription model is understandable.
* So yeah i thought to build a complete open source E book Reader "Lume" and this will be my first prototype...
