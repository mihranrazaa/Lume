**12 JULY**

- SO the plan is to build a alternative of kindle why? because from what i have seen on youtube, kindle can ban your account and your purchased books will be gone, sometimes when the deal between kindle and author of some book gets expired the books automatically vanishes from your account which is crazy, someone is paying full price but still he is not owning that piece, like it is not even a clooud service where subscription model is understandable.
- So yeah i thought to build a complete open source E book Reader "Lume" and this will be my first prototype...

**13 JULY**

- I have figured out my design i will make it, so today i first started by researching what components i will be using as i learnind in AMA if you are building a project which you want someone else to recreate use modules which is a good excuse to my lack of skills, so i selected Rpi zero 2w as my main MCU because it has wifi, blutooth and good support, i have a basic idea of what kind of software i want to build, so it is perfect for that, next i'm using 7.5inch e ink display with driver, vertically not horizontally which is giving more of real book page kind of vibe, then for inputs i first thought of five tactile push buttons for navigating and selecting but then i added a joystick and 4 tackile push buttons which will drastically improve user navigation as i'm building it for myself i think this will be a good choice so yeah also i will be using a battery hat for my pi zero 2w for poratbility ofc.....

- Alright so completed the schematics, i will be using 8pin cable to connect the driver to the main board, also i'm using 5D joystick because normal joystick module required ADC driver and i didn;t wanted to include it, and they both were same priced so i chose this, my idea of the CAD design is i can grab one side of the case with ease like it will be lifted from back and i will add pcb there, so yeah that works, now on to building pcb

- PCB DONEEE!!! so it is like a vertical strip, routing is good i have given adequate spacing for them so it should be fine, i enjoyed building this pcb lol, I've been working this whole day on this lol, i thought of this project yesterday and i now i have created it's PCB, Building is FUN. After coming back home i might start CAD let's see my plan is finishing this till 15th July....

- And yeah here are all the images:
